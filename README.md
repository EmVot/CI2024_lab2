# CI2024_lab2
Laboratory 2 for Computational Intelligence Course

## General overview
The file <lab2-ipynb> contains the solution of the laboratory; in the <Logs> folder you can find costs and steps for all the solutions, organized as:
+ Greedy logs: which containts the journey calculated a vaery simple greedy algorithm

## Code structure
The solution take in considerations two approaches to solve the TSP:
1. A greedy algorithm whihch takes in consideration only the relative distance between the current city and the next candidate one
2. A more refined algorithm which is capable of making smarter decisions

## Problem analysis

## Proposed solutions analysis

## Experiments

## Conclusions
